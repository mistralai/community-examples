# LlamaIndex <> MistralAI Cookbooks

[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) is a data framework for LLM-based applications which benefit from context augmentation. LlamaIndex provides the essential abstractions to more easily ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data in order to inject these safely and reliably into LLMs for more accurate text generation. 

Here we offer some cookbooks for utilizing LlamaIndex with MistralAI's LLM's and Embedding models.

1. `RAG.ipynb` - Notebook to help you build quick RAG and Retriever Pipeline with Mistral.
2. `RouterQueryEngine.ipynb` - Notebook to help you to use `RouterQueryEngine` to route user queries.
3. `SubQuestionQueryEngine.ipynb` - Notebook to help you to use `SubQuestionQueryEngine` to answer complex user queries.
4. `Agents_Tools.ipynb` - Notebook to help you to use `FunctionCallingAgent` and `ReActAgent` for using Tools and RAG QueryEngine Tools.
5. `Adaptive_RAG.ipynb` - Notebook to implement [AdapativeRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403) paper to route user queries based on query complexity using `FunctionCallingAgent` with Mistral LLM.
6. `propertygraphs` - Collection of notebooks to implement and examine [Property Graphs](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/property_graph_basic/) using LlamaIndex, MistralAI, and Ollama.
