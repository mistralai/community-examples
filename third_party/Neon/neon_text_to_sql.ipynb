    "# Building a Text-to-SQL conversion system with Mistral AI, Neon, and LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating natural language queries into SQL statements is a powerful application of large language models (LLMs). While it's possible to ask an LLM directly to generate SQL based on a natural language prompt, it comes with limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The LLM may generate SQL that is syntactically incorrect since the SQL dialect varies across relational databases.\n",
    "2. The LLM doesn't have access to the full database schema, table and column names or indexes, which limits its ability to generate accurate/efficient queries. Passing in the full schema as input to the LLM everytime can get expensive.\n",
    "3. Pretrained LLMs can't adapt to user feedback and evolving text queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finetuning\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to finetune the LLM on your specific text-to-SQL dataset, which might includes query logs from your database and other relevant context. While this approach can improve the LLM's ability to generate accurate SQL queries, it still has limitations adapting continuously. Finetuning can also be expensive which might limit how frequently you can update the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG systems\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are great at in-context learning, so by feeding them relevant information in the prompt, we can improve their outputs. This is the idea behind Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which combine information retrieval with LLMs to generate more informed and contextual responses to queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "By retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base - database schemas, which tables to query, and previously generated SQL queries, we can leverage LLMs to generate SQL queries that are more accurate and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG for text-to-sql\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll walk through building a RAG system using [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) for embeddings and language modeling, [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/) for the vector database. `Neon` is a fully managed serverless PostgreSQL database. It separates storage and compute to offer features such as instant branching and automatic scaling. With the `pgvector` extension, Neon can be used as a vector database to store text embeddings and query them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll set up a sample database, generate and store embeddings for a knowledge-base about it, and then retrieve relevant snippets to answer a query. We use the popular [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) library to tie it all together.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Validate the generated SQL query, especially for destructive operations like `DELETE` and `UPDATE` before executing them. Since the text input comes from a user, it might also cause SQL injection attacks by prompting the system with malicious input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Monitor the system's performance and accuracy over time. We might need to update the LLM model used and the knowledge base embeddings as the data evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Better metadata. While similar examples and database schema are useful, information like data lineage and dashboard logs can add more context to the LLM API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Improving retrieval. For complex queries, we might need to increase the schema information passed to the LLM model. Further, our similarity search heuristic is pretty naive in that we are matching text queries to SQL statements. Using techniques like HyDE (Hypothetical Document Expansion) can improve the quality of the retrieved snippets.\n"
