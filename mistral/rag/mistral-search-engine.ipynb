       "  'chunk': \"OpenAI itself has been embroiled in allegations of copying actor Scartlett Johansson’s voice without her permission. Apple is also at the center of an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and 15 states. The government accuses Apple of abusing its power as a monopoly to push out rivals and keep customers using its products. It’s unclear how Apple’s new partnership with OpenAI could play into this case. Shortly after Apple’s announcement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, “very happy to be partnering with apple to integrate chatgpt into their devices later this year! think you will really like it.”\\nApple is also rolling out what it calls Apple Intelligence, its term for Apple's own new generative AI software. Apple Intelligence will enable transcription for phone calls, AI photo retouching and improvements in the natural conversation flow with Siri, the company said.\"},\n",

       "\"Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) took place on June 10, 2024. The keynote focused mainly on artificial intelligence, with several announcements made. Unfortunately, I don't have real-time information, so I can't provide the specific details of the 13 biggest announcements mentioned in the article from The Verge.\\n\\nHowever, some general expectations before the event included the possibility of new apps for iPadOS such as a native calculator and new features for Apple Pencil 3. For macOS, it was anticipated that there would be AI features and smart tools integrated into native apps like Pages, Keynote, and Xcode.\\n\\nThe event also included video sessions and opportunities for developers to engage with Apple designers and engineers. There was an in-person experience at Apple Park for selected developers to watch the keynote, meet with Apple team members, and participate in special activities. Apple also continued its tradition of supporting the next generation of developers through the Swift Student Challenge.\""
